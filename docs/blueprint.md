## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark cyan (#4db6ac) evoking trust, security, and efficiency.
- Background color: Very light cyan (#edf7f6).  A light background will allow the content to pop.
- Accent color:  A dark, muted green (#388e3c), for 'enter' buttons, confirmation messages, and successful operation alerts.  Analogous with the primary, while still communicating a sense of correctness and approval.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for a modern, clean, and highly readable UI.
- Use clear and intuitive icons from Ant Design to represent parking actions, status, and information.
- Implement a grid-based layout for clear slot visualization and a form-based layout for data entry.
- Subtle transition effects and loading animations for a polished user experience.
